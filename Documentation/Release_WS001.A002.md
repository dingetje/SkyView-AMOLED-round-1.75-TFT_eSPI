# Release WS001.A002

## What has changed?
- Analog Power Bus is disabled. This will save ~10mA since we don't need the ES7210 chip for the dual microphones on the Waveshare board. This change does not seem to affect the Voice audio output.
- Removed all the other display adapter options from the **Settings** page, since this firmware only supports the Waveshare AMOLED 1.75 Round display.
