# Tools

This folder contains some tools for SkyView.

## NMEAUDPServer
The [NMEAUDPServer.zip](NMEAUDPServer.zip) in this folder can be extracted on a Windows PC and act as an UDP data source for the SkyView board for debug purposes.
The tool can be run in a DOS box and requires .NET 8.0 run time.

There's on example NMEA data file included in the archive that simulates a head-on collision, starting about 2 km away until a collision.
This is a simulation scenarion that's generated by a PowerFlarm device.

When executed without arguments, the tool shows a short usage message. The screenshot below shows an example run sending UDP data to SkyView at IP address 192.168.1.161.

In order for this to work, the **Connection type** in the SkyView settings page must be configured to **WiFi UDP** and **Source Id** and **Key** must be set to your local WiFi AP name and password.
After rebooting SkyView the assigned IP address can be found in the status page of the Web Viewer of SkyView at address [192.168.1.1](192.168.1.1).
