## NMEAUDPServer
The [NMEAUDPServer.zip](NMEAUDPServer.zip) in this folder can be extracted on a Windows PC and act as an UDP data source for the SkyView board for debug purposes.

There's on example NMEA data file included in the archive that simulates a head-on collision, starting about 2 km away until a collision.
This is a simulation scenarion that's generated by a PowerFlarm device.
